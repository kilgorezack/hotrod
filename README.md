# Hotrod

**Hyperlocal Open-source Telecom Reach & Overbuild Dashboard**

Hotrod is an open-source dashboard for visually comparing broadband provider coverage maps side-by-side using public FCC data and Apple MapKit JS. It makes it easy to see where different providers overlap or leave gaps in broadband reach — ideal for planners, researchers, and community advocates.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 Compare unlimited broadband coverage maps on a single screen

## 🧠 Motivation

Telecom coverage data can be hard to contextualize when planning infrastructure or evaluating competition. Hotrod brings provider maps into a shared, interactive space so you can answer questions like:

- Where do two or more providers overlap?
- What areas lack broadband competition?
- How does real-world coverage compare to advertised footprints?
